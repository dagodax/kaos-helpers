; Think of ';' as a replacement for comment, do not forget to delete them once finished!
; All UPPER words should be changed to your needs 
; Words starting with @ aren't different, @ symbol is only used by some other kaos automating scripts
;
; Use package name as title (should be the same as the ${pkgname} variable in your PKGBUILD file)
# PKGNAME

; Next should be one line description and should reflect content of ${pkgdesc}
### DESCRIPTION

; Here indicate package website if any. Add more with something 
; like '**Repository**: URL' '**Other-link**: URL' etc... One per line
; But only first one should be required and should be the same as ${url}
**Website**: URL

; From here everything is optional and should be use when needed/required
; Here you can list required kcp packages if any: next sentence isn't ruled,
; but dependancies names should be bold stylized
#### Depends on **DEPNAME**, **NEXTDEPNAME** available via *Kcp*, so you should

; To keep nice reading, list required packages one by line in 
; installation order prefixed with '    * kcp -di yourpkgname'
; DO NOT USE 'kcp -di' anywhere else in this document for parsing purpose.
; First line is unruled as it is only human oriented:
First run kcp in dependance mode with: 
```
    * `kcp -di DEPNAME`
    * `kcp -di NEXTDEPNAME`
```
; Next part is unruled and is only human oriented:
Then you will be able to run:

    * kcp -i PKGNAME

; Next comes an optional more complete description for the packages
; listing its features, changelog or whatever you may want to add.
; Everything should be in between ``` to reflect citation
#### From developer(s):

##### Features

```
    OPTIONALLY ADD MORE DESCRIPTION INFORMATIONS HERE ETC...
```

#### Changelog

```
    August 4, 1997: Skynet system first time online...
```

; Optionaly again, add a screenshot
; Should be named as pkgname ???
; Should be located at git repo root ???
#### Screenshot
